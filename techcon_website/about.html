        <h3>History</h3>

    <p>
      ShadowTech began as a late-night meetup of security researchers and curious builders in 2018.
      What started as a handful of talks in small hacker spaces quickly grew into an annual
      two-day conference that blends hands-on workshops, technical deep-dives, and experimental demos.
      Over the years ShadowTech has evolved from an underground meetup into a respected niche event
      focused on advanced systems, privacy, and adversarial thinking.

        <h3>Mission</h3>

    <p>
      ShadowTech’s mission is to provide a safe, practical space where curious engineers, researchers,
      and creators can explore the darker edges of technology responsibly — from defensive security and
      privacy engineering to experimentation with novel system designs. The conference emphasizes practical
      learning, ethical disclosure, and community-driven knowledge sharing.
